The player selects the column where they want to drop their tile.

The game checks if the selected column is valid. A column is valid if it is not already full of tiles.

If the selected column is valid, the game places the tile in the lowest available row of that column.

The game checks if the tile placement results in a win. A player wins Connect Four by connecting four of their own tiles in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

If the tile placement does not result in a win, the game switches to the other player's turn.
